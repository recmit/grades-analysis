# What is the effect of flipped classroom groups on grades?

We investigate the potential impact on student grades coming from the virtual "flipped classroom" groups which I introduced in my teaching when the Covid-19 pandemic forced all lectures at Lehigh University into an online format. We implement three different hypothesis tests, compare the p-values and estimate the power of the tests through simulations. Specifically, we use the permutation test (nonparametric), the semiparametric bootstrap, and the ANOVA F-test (parametric).
